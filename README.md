## **Concept**

fruGo is an online fresh produce ordering & delivery company that has been providing Australians with their fruit and vegetables since 2003. With several family owned merchant businesses and dispatch facilities in each major city of the country, fruGo has enjoyed being Australia’s most trusted whole food supplier for two decades.
Originally trading as a phone-order service with a proud emphasis on customer relationships, recent rapid growth in demand due to the COVID pandemic has prompted a major upgrade and overhaul of their web marketplace to reflect today’s digital shopping landscape and offer our customers a modernised and improved user experience.
When the world was forced into a predominantly online market in early 2020, fruGo faced challenges competing with other large supermarket chains that offered delivery due to their scale and convenience, however once our new vision of a purely web-based delivery powerhouse is realised, fruGo is confident that it will once again lead the market as Australia’s fresh food supplier.

## **Purpose**

The purpose of building a new online platform for fruGo is to utilise modern technologies to improve the reliability and delivery performance for customers and merchants alike.
Previously, customers would manually choose which merchant to order from and place orders on the telephone. fruGo believes that a successful business is an efficient one, so this process will be streamlined with the use of an online commerce platform using third-party services to automatically evaluate the closest merchant able to fulfil their particular order, enhancing the process for everyone.
Customers can also instantly view product quantities across various merchants in their city to reduce stock issues.
Merchants can now manage their stock quantities in an online database, which is automatically updated by customer orders, reducing the need for manual stocktakes and customer enquiries.

## **User Stories**

**_As the owner of the fruGo company, I would like:_**

[ ] 1. To have a Sign in/Sign up Page for existing & new customers (to ensure online user authentication)

[ ] 2. Each customer must be signed in (assuming they've created their account) in order to view the available fruits & vegetables

[ ] 3. Each customer to only be shown the products available by the merchant in their city (a Melbourne-based customer can view the stock of the Melbourne merchant, etc)

[ ] 4. Anyone can sign up as a **_customer_**, but **_merchants_** can only be added by an **_admin_** user

[ ] 5. Only one admin user (that has full control over all other users (so customers & merchants))

[ ] 6. Each merchant (once signed in) can update their current product availablity (**_add_** new fruits/vegetables, **_update_** the stock of existing ones, or **_delete_** any of their product listings if needed)

[ ] 7. Customers can add desired products (and their respective amounts) to a cart (that automatically updates the total cost); items added to cart cannot exceed current stock availability

[ ] 8. An **_ORDER_** to be created once a cart has been finalised and submitted (each order indicates a completed purchase and includes critical info (customer, merchant, date purchased, amount, etc))

[ ] 9. Completed orders will thereby update the stock (as items have been purchased, so the application must update to the latest availability)
